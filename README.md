# Microfrontend Federation with Vite (Experiment)

This project is an experiment showcasing Microfrontends using Module Federation in Vite. The goal of this setup is to explore the use of microfrontend architecture, where multiple independent front-end applications can be developed, built, and deployed separately but still function seamlessly together in a single application.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Dependencies

   From the root of the project, run the following to install dependencies for each microfrontend and create the build:

   ```bash
   pnpm install:deps
   ```

2. Preview Host Application

   ```bash
   pnpm preview
   ```
